# java-dynamic-class-reloading

# Usage

Eclipse will automatically recompile your source files when you're running the example, so with it you're good to go

# Explanation

In this project I am testing dynamic class reloading - static methods & variables and instance methods & variables.
Basically, you can reload a class on the fly by reading it from the filesystem, but it will not magically replace the original class - you will have to use special methods to invoke functions and retrieve variables.
